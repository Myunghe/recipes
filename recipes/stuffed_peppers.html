    <p>
        Here’s what you’ll need to make these coconut rice-stuffed peppers:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bell peppers</li>
        <li>Coconut rice</li>
        <li>Zucchini</li>
        <li>Extra-firm tofu</li>
        <li>Garlic and scallions</li>
        <li>Jalapeño peppers</li>
        <li>Mango</li>
        <li>Green curry paste</li>
        <li>Fresh lime juice and zest</li>
        <li>Cilantro, basil, and mint</li>
        <li>Sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Make the coconut rice: Combine the rice and coconut milk in a medium pot and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce the heat, and simmer for 15 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed. Remove from the heat and let sit, covered, for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Make the peppers: Slice the peppers in half lengthwise, remove the seeds and membranes, and place on the baking sheet, cut side up. Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and bake for 15 minutes. Tip out and discard any liquid that pools inside the peppers. Set the peppers aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the coconut oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the zucchini, tofu, jalapeños, white and light green parts of the scallions, garlic, and salt, and sauté for about 3 minutes, or until the zucchini is tender.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and stir in the reserved scallion tops, the coconut rice, mango, green curry paste, lime juice and zest, cilantro, and basil.</li>
        <li>Stuff the rice mixture into the peppers, top with the mint, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
